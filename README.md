This is a fan site dedicated to Jimi Hendrix. Users can learn about Jimi Hendrix's life and legacy as well as watch videos from some of his concerts. 

The website consists of three pages. There is a home page where one can see pictures of Jimi, a summary of his legacy, quotes about him, a link to a RollingStone magazine interview, and a table documenting his Grammys. Another page is biographical with paragraphs about Jimi's life paired with pictures. And finally there is a concert footage page with different videos from different stages in Jimi's life paired with contextual sentences. Users can switch between the three pages using a navbar. 

I used HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS in making this project.

I would like to make the formatting between the three pages more uniform. I would like to have a page expanding upon Jimi's blues influences and the Chit'lin Curcuit. I would like to add more videos to the video page and add more context to the videos.
